       <h3><a name="akshara"></a>Akshara Foundation</h3>
        <p> Since its inception in March 2000, Akshara has touched the lives of over 800,000 children in the state of Karnataka, India. Over the last thirteen years, Akshara has run <a href="http://akshara.org.in/programmes" target="_blank"> multiple programmes</a> that have all been designed to be comprehensive, scalable, replicable and cost-effective remedial or supplementary education solutions. 
        </p><p>All Akshara's programs are child-centric and are designed to ensure that :
        enrolment in schools increase,
         drop-outs from schools decrease, and
         that children's learning outcomes and overall development improve.
        In particular, Akshara works in close partnership with the Education Department of the Government of Karnataka and the Department of Women and Child Welfare to supplement existing primary school and pre-primary school programs. Here are links to Akshara Foundation's reports:

<h3><a name="aser"></a>ASER</h3>
<p>
Every year since 2005, the non government organization Pratham has facilitated an innovative exercise: that of implementing the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER). This enormous annual task engages citizens across the country in understanding and tracking children's ability to read and do basic arithmetic via the participation of local organizations and institutions in every rural district in the country. It is the largest household survey of children conducted in India by citizens' groups, carried out by more than 25,000 volunteers and covering over 700,000 children in 15,000 villages each year. It is also the only annual source of information regarding learning levels of children in elementary school.

- make the development discourse between elected representatives and citizens better informed and backed by specific data, rather than only relying on perceptions; and
<br/>    
- enable citizen groups and elected representatives to use such government data to strengthen their demands for greater government intervention on development issues relevant to them.

Published early in 2010 by Cisco, Learning from the Extemes examines how social entrepreneurs around the world are devising new approaches to learning in extreme social circumstances - favelas, slums, informal settlements - when there are few teachers, schools, text books. The radically innovative approaches they develop challenge conventional wisdom about schooling and provide new insights into how the developed world should reform its education systems. The report is available <a href="http://www.charlesleadbeater.net/cms/xstandard/LearningfromExtremes_WhitePaper.pdf" target="_blank" > here. </a>
